## 🎯 QUICK LOOKUPS

### "What does the Sage do?"
→ **`mustang_sage_v2_4_0_complete.md`**

### "How do I use factories?"
→ **`08_AGNOSTIC_FACTORIES.md`** + **`agent.md`** (factories section)

### "What are my responsibilities?"
→ **`GENERIC-[N]-[ROLE]-role-skill.md`** (find your role number)

### "How do I test this?"
→ **`GENERIC-07-qa-engineer-role-skill.md`** + **`01_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`** (7-step protocol)

### "What's the risk if something goes wrong?"
→ **`02_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md`** (risk assessment section) + **`GENERIC-14-devils-advocate-role-skill.md`**

### "How do I deploy this?"
→ **`06_INFRASTRUCTURE_AS_CODE.md`** + **`GENERIC-05-devops-manager-role-skill.md`**

### "What's the audit schedule?"
→ **`09_AUDIT_AND_MAINTENANCE.md`** + **`07_CONFIGURATION_CONTROL.md`** (`scale.yaml`)

### "How does this system handle [X]?"

## 📝 BEFORE YOU START BUILDING

### Step 1: Read This Manifest (5 min)
You're reading it now. ✅

### Step 2: Read the System Prompt (10 min)
Open **`mustang_sage_v2_4_0_complete.md`** and skim it. Understand what the four agents do.

### Step 3: Read Your Role Skill (10 min)
Find your role in the list above. Read that specific skill file. Understand your authority and responsibilities.

### Step 4: Read the Agent Kernel (5 min)
Open **`agent.md`**. It tells you (and the AI tools) how to follow the framework.

### Step 5: Assign Roles (5 min)
Create **`docs/mustang-sage/ROLE_ASSIGNMENTS.md`**:
```markdown
# Mustang Sage — Role Assignments

Product Manager: [Your Name] | slack: [@user]
Architect: [Your Name] | slack: [@user]
... (all 12 roles)
```

### Step 6: Create AgentSpec (30 min)
Use **`MASTER_AGENT_DISCOVERY_PROMPT.md`** with a strong LLM to lock down:
- MVP scope (Phase 1 only: Quoting + Compliance)
- Risk score (confirmed: 11/17)
- Orchestration (confirmed: Antigravity)
- Required guardrails (HITL, geo-lock, margin floor, estimate watermark)
- Success metrics
- Phase 1 implementation order

Output: **`docs/AgentSpec.md`** (the spec that Architect and AI Engineer follow)

### Step 7: Start Building
Hand **`docs/AgentSpec.md`** + **`mustang_sage_v2_4_0_complete.md`** to AI Engineer.

They build using:
- **`GENERIC-AGENT-TEMPLATE-SKILL.md`** (template for each agent)
- **`08_AGNOSTIC_FACTORIES.md`** (factory pattern)
- **`.build-context.md`** (to log decisions)

## 🚀 YOU'RE READY

Everything you need to build Mustang Sage is in this library.

**Nothing is hidden. Everything is referenced.**

When builders ask questions, they search this manifest first. If the answer isn't here, they create a new document and add it to the manifest.

---

## 📌 MANIFEST META

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** April 11, 2026  
**Purpose:** Single source of truth for Mustang Sage project  
**Update:** Add new docs to the manifest as they're created  
**Audience:** AI Engineer, Architect, all 12 roles, AI tools (Cursor, Claude Code, Antigravity)

---

## 🎯 THE GOLDEN RULE

> **"If it's not in the manifest, it doesn't exist yet. Create it, add it here, and reference it."**

This keeps the project organized, searchable, and handoff-ready.
